# UI editor

An editor to setup visual appearance of [**frontends**](/docs/implementation/frontend.md), first and foremost [web-frontend](/docs/implementation/frontend.md#web-frontend).

Conceptually shows the UI of the web-frontend as the _source of truth_, because web-frontend encompasses most of UI settings possible for any frontend. Then any other frontend can adopt these settings as much as they can.
