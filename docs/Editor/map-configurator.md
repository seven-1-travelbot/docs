Visualizes [map backbone](../concept-design/map.md) and lets you add new locations or edit existing, as well as setup bot's behaviour.

## Features

- Add new locations via [webscraping](../concept-design/webscraping.md)

- Customize bot's behaviour via [behaviour lines](../concept-design/map.md#behaviour-line)

- Setup [data sources](../concept-design/RAG/data-retrieval.md#data-sources) for locations
