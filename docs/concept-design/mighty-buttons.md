# Mighty buttons

Mighty buttons help user to interact with a bot faster, establishing **fast flow** of the conversation.
These buttons are suggestions that appear after bot's answer.

When a user gets a text answer generated from LLM, they can write their answer freely (open question) or pick one of the mighty buttons to continue the conversation.

Suggestions are generated in real time in response to bot answer by querying LLM.
