# Goals and problems

What problems user encounters in modern chatbot conversations.

## Problems

- ### Human communication is **not** only _text_

  A nice image of a product can tell **more**, than its description. Also **first** impression is always **visual**, so a right picture can make even a moderate answer appealing to the user.

- ### Writing is tough

  In programming we have a "boilerplate" code, so we do in chatting. It's is always easier to say "yes" or "no" and not think about actual sentence structure. And chatting with AI is not an exception.

- ### Chatbot is a silent "_sage_"

  It can answer questions, but usually doesn't push the conversation further. Yet if a bot does this, you cannot directly control where the conversation will go.

## Goals

- ### User guidance (pushing the conversation forward)

  Provide a framework to guide a user from **creating an interest** to **observing** different products, then to **selecting** right ones, and then to **buying** them.
  We have to create a _comprehensive_ and _personalized_ experience.

- ### Configurable behaviour

  Introduce **cross-selling** and **up-selling** mechanisms with configurable behaviour. Control the flow of the conversation.

- ### Diversify an output

  Include images and other media content in

- ### Answer and dialog theme suggestions

  Firstly, people don't know, what to ask, if they are not searching for something particular, so we can suggest a theme.
  Secondly, it is easier to click a button or swipe, than to write an answer manually. Let's simplify bot interactions as we much as we can, yet giving full ability to write open questions.
