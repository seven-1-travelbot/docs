# Augmentation

Second phase of a standard RAG pipeline

When necessary data is retrieved, we are ready to augment the **prompt** to LLM. This process also is **location** dependent.
It checks location's [behaviour line](../map.md#behaviour-line) and by combining this info with **retrieved data** constructs the prompt.

:::note
Add augmented prompt examples.
