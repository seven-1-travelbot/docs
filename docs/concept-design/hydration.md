# Hydration

Last phase of creating an answer.

To create an appealing answer we need to add **media content** to the text received from LLM.
Media content for hydration phase is received during [**retrieval**](./RAG/data-retrieval.md) phase.

Text is combined with media and [mighty buttons](./mighty-buttons.md) to form a _widget_.

:::info
Hydration happens on [frontend](/docs/implementation/frontend.md) and is frontend dependent.
