# Overview

The main idea around the whole **platform** is called [**RAG**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation). We are trying to build on top of this by providing reasonable **data scoping** and **behaviour control** over the chatting. ([See map](./map.md))

Also by controlling the whole _stack_ (data scraping, saving, augmentation, chat UI, etc.) we are trying to further _optimize_ the concept and UX to bring **new modals** to the common chatting experience (like images and product widgets). These ideas can be useful in highly visual businesses and businesses, where bot's common tasks include:

- Marketing

- Cross-selling and up-selling

- Packages assembling

- FAQ answering
